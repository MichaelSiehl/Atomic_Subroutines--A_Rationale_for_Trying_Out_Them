# Atomic Subroutines: A Rationale for Trying Out Them
Fortran 2008 coarray programming with unordered execution segments (user-defined ordering) - Atomic Subroutines: a rationale for trying out them

# Overview

I open this to briefly share some of my personal thoughts and hopes for the development of parallel software in the many-core era. This may also give a rationale for at least trying out parallel programming using Fortran 2008 atomic subroutines and the SYNC MEMORY statement.
